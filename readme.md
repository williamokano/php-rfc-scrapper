# PHP RFC Scrapper
Getting the last changes "made worng".

Keep track of new RFC's, moved RFC's (between status), deleted RFC's and so... no, just that actually. For now. Or ever. Who knows?

# How to run
Simply run `npm install && npm start`

# How it works
Pay close attention to the output, it will show what have changed.

But... if you missed what have changed, or everything has changed, you can simply open the nice `.log` file created (I hope) on the project path and look for the changes. But you should really pay attention to the Console output. Seriously.

# How can I help
Pull request, translations, code improvement; anything. Please!

# Why I have done that?
I really don't know.
